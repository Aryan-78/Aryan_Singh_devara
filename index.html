								<u><h3>Turtle Race Master</h3></u>
								Skill Required: &nbsp;<span class="button small">Python</span>&nbsp;
								<span class="button small">Object-Oriented Programming</span> &nbsp; 
								<span class="button small">Fuzzy Logic</span>&nbsp; 
								<span class="button small">Algorithm</span>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/4.PNG" alt="" /></span>
								<p> Creating a turtle race simulator from scratch which uses fuzzy inputs so that max membership function turtle wins, where else it also shows the crisp output. It helps us to understand the importance of a fuzzy system in the real world. Its main challenge of doing that project was not to use the fuzzy module in python
								</p>
								Output <br><br>
								<pre><code>Would you like to play again Yes

write the input fuzzy value for the turtle 1

write the input fuzzy value for the turtle 2

write the input fuzzy value for the turtle 5

write the input fuzzy value for the turtle 3

write the input fuzzy value for the turtle 8

write the input fuzzy value for the turtle 1

write the input fuzzy value for the turtle 2

write the input fuzzy value for the turtle 6


The actual crisp value for the given fuzzy set: 
4.448


The winner is:

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/snip1.PNG" alt="" /></span>
							<p>It was a project in which I learn and understand how to use computer vision so that we create landmarks on the face through which we can do many interesting things.
							</p><p>	We use shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat for our project which has been trained by ibug database which is over 5000 over database images so that's why it is very accurate and fast.

								<u><h3>Quadrator</h3></u>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Cer1.PNG" alt="" /></span>
								<p>It was a two-day workshop in which on the first day we learn the physics of the copter like how the wings lift the plane, Thrust, Drag, Lift, Payload, Roll Motion, YawnMotion, Pitch Motion.</p>
								<p>On the second day, we created our own quadra-copter using KK2.1.5 flight microcontroller and even assign a PID system to the copter and at the end, we fly it in the ground.</p>

								<p>Currently, I serve as a Software Analyst at PTC, where I am part of the migration team responsible for transitioning on-premises devices to cloud infrastructure.</p>
								<p>We have developed an internal tool within Windchill called CCD (Code Configuration and Deployment Tools). This tool is primarily responsible for configuring customer artifacts, code, and data, compiling it, and distributing it within Windchill.</p>
								<p>Additionally, we created a cloud infrastructure tool, WC-SCCM (Windchill Source Code Cloud Management), which operates in GitLab. This tool is primarily used for version management of customer customizations and for retrieving customer data when needed.</p>
    							<p>I have worked on all aspects of these tools, with my major contribution being the creation of the pipeline for WC-SCCM Testcase Data and ChainSet Management UI Tools.</p>
